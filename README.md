1. *Data Collection and Cleaning*: Gather information about traffic accidents, including where and when they happened, weather conditions, and road types. Clean the data by fixing missing values and converting categories (like weather) into numbers so the model can understand them.

2. *Building the Model*: Choose a machine learning method (like Decision Trees) to create a model that learns from the cleaned data. The model will find patterns that link different factors (like traffic volume and time of day) to the chances of an accident happening.

3. *Testing and Evaluating*: After training the model, test it with new data to see how well it predicts accidents. Use simple metrics to check its accuracy, helping you understand how reliable the predictionsÂ are.
